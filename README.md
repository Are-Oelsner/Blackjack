# Blackjack
 Blackjack simulation created from scratch while learning Python

To-do:
# Check dealers hand for 21 before hitting
# If the dealer has >= 17 with first two cards it must stand. If it is 16 or under it must take a card.
# It must then continue to take cards until the total is 17 or higher, but not over 21, or goes bust if it
# is over 21. The dealer must count an ace as 11 and stand
# Allow Aces to be 1 or 11
# Add support for splitting and doubling down
